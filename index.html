    <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The tutorials listed in this page
        will allow you to execute and test a Cloud-Based IoT system developed
        for the exam of the IoT 2019/2020 course to manage a set of virtual
        environmental station and a crowd-sensing application for detecting
        user's physical activity.All the code through which this project is
        implemented is available on <a href="">GitHub</a>.</span></p>

              1</b></a>: this assignment required to create a cloud-based IoT
          system collecting information from a <em>set of virtual environmental
            sensors</em> using the MQTT protocol. Data collected from the
          sensors should be displayed by a <em>simple web site</em>.<br>

      <li><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="assignment2.html"><b>Assignment
              2</b></a>: this assignment is an extension of Assignment 1, where
          the same components (dashboard and backend) are used to collect and
          display data from a set of virtual environmental stations that are
          built over <i>RIOT-OS</i> and transmit using the <i>MQTT-SN</i>
          protocol.</span></li>

      <li><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="assignment3.html"><b>Assignment
              3</b></a>: this assignment is another extension of the projects
          for Assignment 1 and 2, where the same dashboard and backend
          components are used to collect and display data from a set of virtual
          environmental stations that are built over <i>RIOT-OS</i>, are
          deployed on the <i>FIT/IoT Lab</i> testbed and transmit the generated
          values using <i>LoRaWAN</i> by <i>TheThingsNetwork</i>.</span></li>
      <span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
      <li><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="assignment4.html"><b>Assignment
              4</b></a>: this assignment extends the IoT platform designed for
          the previous assignments by introducing <i>crowd-sensing</i> support.
          In particular, this assignment required to implement an <i>HTML5</i>
          application that could support a user's activity detection (using the
          sensors integrated in mobile phones) and recognition. Activity
          detection exploits the <i>Generic Sensor API</i>, while the
          recognition can be performed either on the mobile device (edge
          deployment) or remotely (cloud deployment). A dashboard, similar to
          the one for the virtual environmental sensors shows the activity of
          the users.
